# About Our Research

Ion channels serve as fundamental components in cellular signaling and electrophysiological activities, playing critical regulatory roles throughout the reproductive and endocrine systems. Our research is focused on elucidating the functional mechanisms and pathological significance of ion channels in reproductive physiology and endocrine regulation. We aim to systematically uncover their dynamic roles in physiological processes and the disease phenotypes resulting from their dysfunction.

## Research Focus

### Ion Channels in the Reproductive System
Ion channels are involved in multiple key stages of reproduction, including:
- Gametogenesis
- Gamete maturation
- Fertilization
- Early embryonic development

**Notable examples:**
- **Calcium channels** mediate sperm capacitation and the acrosome reaction.
- **Potassium channels** regulate oocyte membrane potential and influence fertilization competence.
- **TRP channels** and **chloride channels** participate in regulating cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation during embryo implantation.

We employ advanced techniques—including **patch-clamp electrophysiology**, **gene-knockout animal models**, and **high-resolution live-cell imaging**—to investigate the expression profiles, functional mechanisms, and microenvironmental regulation of specific ion channels throughout reproductive processes.

### Ion Channels in the Endocrine System
Within the endocrine system, ion channels play a central role in:
- Hormone synthesis
- Hormone secretion
- Metabolic homeostasis

**Key research areas:**
- **KATP channels** and **voltage-gated calcium channels (CaV)** in pancreatic β-cells coregulate insulin secretion.
- Ion channels across the **hypothalamic-pituitary-target gland axis** contribute to pulsatile hormone release and stress responses.

Dysfunction of ion channels in endocrine tissues (thyroid, adrenal glands, gonads) has been linked to:
- Dysregulated hormone synthesis
- Metabolic syndrome
- Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
- Impaired fertility

## Interdisciplinary Approach

Our laboratory integrates innovative methodologies for the **optical and ultrasonic modulation of ion channels**. We aim to harness ion channels as biological switches that can be remotely controlled using:

- **Optogenetic technologies**
- **Ultrasound-based technologies**

By exploiting properties of **light- and sound-sensitive ion channels**, we achieve spatiotemporally precise, non-invasive manipulation of cellular functions. These advances enable regulation of:

- Neural circuit activity
- Hormone secretion
- Immune responses

These novel modulation tools show promise for developing therapeutic strategies for:

- Neurological disorders
- Endocrine diseases
- Immune-related conditions

## Overall Goal

We strive to:
1. Uncover novel disease mechanisms through ion channel biology
2. Facilitate development of precise intervention strategies
3. Contribute to improved diagnostic and treatment options
4. Advance next-generation precision medicine interventions
