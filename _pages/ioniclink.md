ionicLINK is an innovative team dedicated to intelligent mental health solutions. Our vision is to transcend existing market paradigms by leveraging cutting-edge biomedical research to transform laboratory-grade neurotechnology into safe, accessible consumer health products. We are committed to leveraging technology to alleviate anxiety, enhance human mental well-being, and ultimately realize our vision of **"a world without anxiety."**

## Scientific Foundation

The scientific foundation of this project stems from systematic research in low-intensity pulsed ultrasound neuromodulation and ion channel functional mechanisms conducted in our laboratory. The team plans to systematically investigate the interventional effects of different artistic forms of music on cognitive and social functions in schizophrenia model mice, aiming to reveal the intrinsic mechanisms by which music activates specific brain regions and modulates the release of neurotransmitters such as dopamine through sonic co-frequency and neural resonance at molecular and circuit levels. This provides solid evidence for music as a non-invasive, low-cost, and highly compliant neural intervention method.

## Technology Application

Based on this discovery, the ionicLINK team aims to develop an intelligent wearable device that integrates sonic guidance and transcranial ultrasound neuromodulation technologies, achieving a leap from **"animal mechanisms"** to **"human applications."** This device will not only possess real-time physiological signal monitoring and closed-loop feedback capabilities but will also rely on algorithms to generate personalized sonic intervention programs, advancing mental health intervention from traditional **"content listening"** to a new stage of **"precision modulation"** based on neural responses.

## Our Vision

We are building a science-based, experience-centric, and data-driven intelligent mental health platform, striving to become a benchmark enterprise in the global consumer-grade neurotechnology field.
